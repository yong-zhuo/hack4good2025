## **Inspiration**
The idea for Minimart@MWH came from a problem statement by MWH that challenged us to create a digital minimart powered by a token economy. We found this idea both novel and meaningful, as it could teach residents valuable skills like financial management, foster positive behavior, and improve discipline, all while motivating them to learn and grow.

## **How to Access the Admin Account**
To log in as an administrator, follow these steps:

1. On the welcome page, click the **Admin** button.
2. Use the following credentials to log in:
   - **Email**: `123@email.com`
   - **Password**: `123123`

Due to time constraints and the complexity of implementing a secure admin account creation system, we opted to provide a single pre-configured admin account for now. This decision ensures that the admin account cannot be abused by residents, safeguarding the platformâ€™s integrity while maintaining functionality. Future updates will focus on improving this feature.

---

## **Challenges Faced**
- **Edge Cases**: Designing a seamless user experience required handling numerous edge cases for both residents and administrators.
- **Learning Curve**: Adapting to new technologies like Firebase, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS posed initial challenges.
- **Time Constraints**: Developing a fully functional prototype within 4 days while managing schoolwork was demanding.

---

## **Accomplishments**
- Delivered a polished and functional prototype within 4 days.
- Integrated robust features for both residents and administrators.
- Learned and utilized new technologies, enhancing our web development skills.

---

## **What's Next**
- **Automation**: Integrate LMS platforms or behavior trackers for automated voucher distribution.
- **POS Integration**: Automate stock updates through point-of-sale systems.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhance the user interface for better accessibility and usability.
